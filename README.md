# Blinky Rust with the RP2040

This repo contains a simple example to blink a PIN on the RP2040 board.  This is different from most other examples, though, because it does it by manually configuring the control registers.

## Running

- `cargo build` to build the binary.
- `cargo run` to install and run it using `probe-rs`
